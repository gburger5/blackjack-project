my-first-project = "blackjack"

This is my first "longer" project which is built off of the real life game of blackjack. 

In this project I display some of the fundamentals I have been working towards such as:
- Loops
- If, Elif, and Else Functions
- Input Functions
- Boolean Values
- Manipulating Integers
- Importing Data

Although this would be considered humble beginnings, I am proud of the start and look forward to what programming and software has in store for me, and what I can bring to the table in the future.
